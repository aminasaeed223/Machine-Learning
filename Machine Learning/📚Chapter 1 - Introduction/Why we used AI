# 1.1 – Why We Used AI  

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a scientific discipline that focuses on enabling computers to exhibit **intelligent behavior**, i.e., performing tasks that humans are naturally skilled at.

## Background  

Computers were first conceptualized by **Charles Babbage** in the 19th century to operate on numbers using well-defined procedures called *algorithms*.  
Even though modern computers are far more advanced, they still follow the same core principle of **controlled computations**.  

This means a computer can only perform a task **if we know the exact sequence of steps** to achieve the goal.  

> Some tasks, however, cannot be explicitly programmed.  
>  
> **Example:** Estimating a person’s age from a photograph. Humans learn to do this through experience, but we cannot precisely explain the rules. Such problems are exactly what **Artificial Intelligence** is designed to solve.

## Why AI Is Needed  

### Traditional Programming  
- Relies on fixed rules (*if–then–else* statements).  
- Each new functionality requires writing additional instructions.  
- Poor at handling uncertainty or adaptation.  

### Artificial Intelligence  
- Learns patterns directly from data.  
- Adapts to new, unseen situations.  
- Provides **generalized** solutions rather than rigid instructions.  

Conventional programming requires specifying every single step in detail.  
When the task is too complex or poorly understood, this becomes **impractical**.  
AI overcomes this by **learning and making decisions autonomously**.

## Early Breakthrough: Arthur Samuel’s Checkers Program  

- In **1956**, Arthur Samuel developed one of the first self-learning programs.  
- Instead of manually coding all moves, he allowed the computer to:  
  1. **Play checkers against itself repeatedly** (thousands of games).  
  2. **Improve through experience**, refining its strategy over time.  

By **1962**, Samuel’s program defeated the **Connecticut state champion**, proving that a computer could *learn by itself*.

## Modern Applications of AI  

AI has become central across industries, solving problems beyond the reach of traditional programming:  

- **Finance** → Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, risk analysis, customer support.  
- **Medicine** → Diagnosing diseases from images, drug discovery, personalized treatment plans.  
- **Arts & Creativity** → Music and art generation, content recommendation, film editing.

## Reflection  

✅ **Think about it:** What tasks in your work or daily life could you delegate to a computer if it could *learn* instead of requiring explicit instructions?
