Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed from a visionary concept into an indispensable technology reshaping our world. From its philosophical roots and early computations to modern machine learning breakthroughs, AI now powers everyday toolsâ€”voice assistants, recommendation systems, and cutting-edge healthcare diagnostics. In this post, weâ€™ll explore why humans created AI, trace its evolution from symbolic logic to neural networks, clarify what AI truly means today, and showcase real-world applications driving innovation across industries.

## **Why we used AI** 

Artificial Intelligence is an exciting scientific discipline that studies how we can make computers exhibit intelligent behavior, e.g. do those things that human beings are good at doing.
Originally, computers were invented by **Charles Babbage** to operate on numbers following a well-defined procedure - an algorithm. Modern computers, even though significantly more advanced than the original model proposed in the 19th century, still follow the same idea of controlled computations. Thus it is possible to program a computer to do something if we know the exact sequence of steps that we need to do in order to achieve the goal.

 ## **Unsupervised learning**
 
Unsupervised learning, in essence, is the machine learning task of uncovering hidden patterns and structures from unlabeled data. For example, a business may wish to group its customers into distinct categories based on their purchasing behavior without knowing in advance what these categories may be. This is known as clustering, one branch of unsupervised learning.

## **Reinforcement learning** 

There is also reinforcement learning, in which machines or software agents interact with an environment. Reinforcement agents are able to automatically figure out how to optimize their behavior given a system of rewards and punishments. Reinforcement learning draws inspiration from behavioral psychology and has applications in many fields, such as, economics, genetics, as well as game playing. In 2016, reinforcement learning was used to train Google DeepMindâ€™s AlphaGo, which was the first computer program to beat the world champion in Go.

## **Supervised learning explanation** 

In supervised learning, we have several data points or samples, described using predictor variables or features and a target variable. Our data is commonly represented in a table structure such as the one you see here, in which there is a row for each data point and a column for each feature. Here, we see the iris dataset: each row represents measurements of a different flower and each column is a particular kind of measurement, like the width and length of a certain part of the flower. The aim of supervised learning is to build a model that is able to predict the target variable, here the particular species of a flower, given the predictor variables, here the physical measurements. If the target variable consists of categories, like â€˜clickâ€™ or â€˜no clickâ€™, â€˜spamâ€™ or â€˜not spamâ€™, or different species of flowers, we call the learning task classification. Alternatively, if the target is a continuously varying variable, for example, the price of a house, it is a regression task. In this chapter, we will focus on classification. In the following, on regression.
