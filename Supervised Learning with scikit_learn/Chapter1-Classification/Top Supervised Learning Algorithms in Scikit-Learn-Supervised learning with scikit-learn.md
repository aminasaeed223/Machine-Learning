Supervised learning is a cornerstone of machine learning, enabling us to build models that classify data accurately and make predictions on new instances. Scikit-Learn is a popular machine learning library in Python that provides a variety of classification algorithms. Classification is a fundamental task in machine learning, where the goal is to assign a label or category to a given input based on its features.

In this guide, we explore key classification algorithms in Scikit-Learn, including

- Logistic Regression,
- SVM,
- Neural Networks,
- KNN
- Tree-based methods (DT,RF)

Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or looking to deepen your knowledge, this step-by-step tutorial will walk you through using Scikit-Learn in Python to create, train, and evaluate machine learning models effectively. Discover how to choose the best algorithm for your dataset and improve model accuracy with Scikit-Learn‚Äôs powerful tools

# **Understanding Classification** 

Def: Classification is a supervised learning technique in which we train a model on labeled data to make predictions on unseen instances. The labeled data consists of input variables (features) and output variables (labels or classes). The goal is to learn a mapping function that can accurately predict the class labels of new instances.

When it comes to classification, there are two main types: binary classification and multiclass classification. In binary classification, the target variable has only two classes, such as spam or not spam. In multiclass classification, the target variable can have more than two classes, like classifying images into different categories.

# **Common steps of Scikit-Learn for classification**

To use Scikit-Learn for classification, you can follow these steps:
Import the necessary libraries.
- Load the data.
- Split the data into a training set and a test set.
- Choose a classification algorithm.
- Train the model on the training set.
- Evaluate the model on the test set.
- Make predictions on new data.

# **Scikit-Learn Installation**
 
From the notebook, you can ensure this via;



<pre> ```python -m pip install --upgrade scikit-learn==0.23.0 ``` </pre>


Alternatively, you could also run this from the command line inside of a virtual environment;

python -m pip install --upgrade scikit-learn==0.23.0
