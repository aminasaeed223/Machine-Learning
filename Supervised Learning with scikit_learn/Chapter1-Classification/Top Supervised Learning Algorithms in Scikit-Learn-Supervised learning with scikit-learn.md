# **Understanding Classification** 

Def: Classification is a supervised learning technique in which we train a model on labeled data to make predictions on unseen instances. The labeled data consists of input variables (features) and output variables (labels or classes). The goal is to learn a mapping function that can accurately predict the class labels of new instances.

When it comes to classification, there are two main types: binary classification and multiclass classification. In binary classification, the target variable has only two classes, such as spam or not spam. In multiclass classification, the target variable can have more than two classes, like classifying images into different categories.

**Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** The goal here is to make machines comprehend and interpret human language. NLU allows systems to recognize the intent behind the text or speech, extracting key information such as emotions, entities, and actions. For instance, when you ask a voice assistant ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the weather like?‚Äù, NLU helps the system determine that the user is asking for weather information.

**Natural Language Generation (NLG):** Once a machine understands human input, NLG takes over by generating appropriate responses. An example of this is AI writing assistants that can craft sentences or paragraphs based on the data provided.

**Def: Natural language refers** to the medium in which humans communicate with each other. This could be in the form of writing (text) for example emails, articles, news, blogs, bank documents, etc, or speech for example lectures, speeches, audio calls, etc. NLP is one of the major AI technologies aimed at making machines capable enough to interpret speech and text-based human language.

**Def: Natural Language Processing** is a branch of linguistics, AI, and CS for the manipulation, and translation of natural language which gives machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human language. Simply put, NLP is a set of computational techniques that allow machines to understand and manipulate human spoken languages. But how is that possible?

There are trillions of web pages full of natural text, so imagine the scale of data available today. NLP algorithms often model the hierarchical structure of natural language i.e. characters form words, words form phrases, phrases form sentences, sentences form paragraphs, and paragraphs form documents .

 



Natural Language Processing (or NLP for short) consists of developing a set of algorithms and tools so that machines can make sense of data available in natural (human) languages such as English, German, French, etc. Although there are traces of NLP research since a long time ago, the concept got well defined in the 1950s, with the breakthrough research work of Alan Turing and Noam Chomsky.

# **Brief History of NLP**

Natural Language Processing (NLP) boasts a diverse history that stretches across multiple decades. The domain of NLP has undergone substantial evolution, starting from its inception in the 1950s to the present-day advanced models capable of comprehending and producing language akin to humans.

**Early Years (1950s-1960s)**

The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, spearheaded by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude Shannon, is frequently cited as the origin of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). During the 1950s and 1960s, pioneers such as Alan Turing, Noam Chomsky, and Marvin Minsky established the groundwork for NLP through their investigations into machine learning, linguistics, and computer science.

**Rule-Based Approach (1970s-1980s)**

During the 1970s and 1980s, research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) was centered on rule-based methods for language processing. This required the formulation of hand-coded rules for the analysis and generation of language. While this method achieved some level of success, it was ultimately constrained by its lack of capacity to manage the intricacies and variations of human language.

**Statistical Approach (1990s-2000s)**

During the 1990s and 2000s, there was a transition to statistical methods in natural language processing (NLP). Researchers started to employ machine learning algorithms and statistical models for language analysis and generation. These methods proved to be more efficient than rule-based systems, although they also had drawbacks, such as the need for extensive annotated datasets.

**Deep Learning Era (2010s-present)**

The 2010s heralded the advent of the deep learning revolution in natural language processing (NLP). The emergence of vast datasets, significant improvements in computational power, and innovative algorithms such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and transformers have facilitated the development of highly sophisticated and accurate NLP models.

# **Application**

Let's discuss some common NLP applications and use cases:

**1- Document Classification (Text Classification)**

Deals with classifying textual documents and assigning it to one or multiple categories. Example applications include classifying news articles into categories like sports, politics, business, technology, etc, or segregating different types of invoices and sales deeds in a large company.

**Document Clustering**

is used to find similar documents and segregate them to form groups. Documents that are closely related will be part of the same group. Example applications include finding similar questions that have already posted in a forum, or finding new published medical research related to a patient's symptoms.

**Sentiment Analysis**

It is the process of analyzing emotions from text and classifying classes based on its content like Positive and Negative. We can use Sentiment analysis for product reviews, Customer feedback, News articles, social media comments, and many more. For Example, Let‚Äôs think about product reviews. We can classify those reviews as Positive, Negative, and Neutral using sentiment analysis without reading manually. NLP is used to classify text for different sentiments ranging from negative to neutral to positive. This is commonly used to understand customer opinions from product reviews or their posts on social media.[3].

**Keyword Extraction**

It is the process of extracting important keywords from some text or document. It helps to summarize the content and to find the main topics in the content.[3]

**Document Summarization**

NLP helps to extract the most important and central ideas in a document. For example, one could train a model to summarize a 3000-word article to 200 words. This allows the reader to save time and get the gist, and is often useful for news, research papers, etc.

**Named Entity Recognition**,

also known as entity extraction, identifies named entities and classifies them into categories such as person, organization, location, etc. Such a system can be used by stock investors to follow news corresponding to companies they have invested in, or to get news relating to your favorite sports players and teams from across various news sources.

**Question Answering systems**

are intelligent systems that generate responses to the questions being asked by the user. Such systems often use facts and rules stored in their knowledge base. Many conversational AI and personal assistant solutions (for example Amazon Alexa) are able to perform question answering.

**Machine Translation**

it is the task of automatically translating from one natural language to another. This is the task Google translate is performing when you visit a website that is written in a language you do not understand.It is a most powerful example in Natural Language Processing. It is the process of some content being translated to another language. Google translate can translate different natural languages to each other using NLP techniques.[3].

**Chatbot**

Chatbots are another interesting application in NLP. They can understand some common queries and can respond. By now most business websites have chatbots to interact with customers.[3]
